# Access Control



## Basic Example using a Struct


In Swift 3 there are multiple access-levels. This example uses them all except for `open`:

```swift
public struct Car {
    
    public let make: String
    let model: String //Optional keyword: will automatically be "internal"
    private let fullName: String
    fileprivate var otherName: String
    
    public init(_ make: String, model: String) {
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.fullName = "\(make)\(model)"
        self.otherName = "\(model) - \(make)"
    }
}

```

Assume `myCar` was initialized like this:

```swift
let myCar = Car("Apple", model: "iCar")

```

### Car.make (public)

```swift
print(myCar.make)

```

This print will work everywhere, including targets that import `Car`.

### Car.model (internal)

```swift
print(myCar.model)

```

This will compile if the code is in the same target as `Car`.

### Car.otherName (fileprivate)

```swift
print(myCar.otherName)

```

This will only work if the code is **in the same file** as `Car`.

### Car.fullName (private)

```swift
print(myCar.fullName)

```

This won't work in Swift 3. `private` properties can only be accessed within the same `struct`/`class`.

```swift
public struct Car {

    public let make: String       //public
    let model: String             //internal
    private let fullName: String! //private 

    public init(_ make: String, model model: String) {
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.fullName = "\(make)\(model)"
    }
}

```

If the entity has multiple associated access levels, Swift looks for the lowest level of access. If a private variable exists in a public class, the variable will still be considered private.



## Subclassing Example


```swift
public class SuperClass {
    private func secretMethod() {}
}
 
internal class SubClass: SuperClass {
    override internal func secretMethod() {
        super.secretMethod()
    }
}

```



## Getters and Setters Example


```swift
struct Square {
    private(set) var area = 0

    var side: Int = 0 {
        didSet {
            area = side*side
        }
    }
}

public struct Square {
    public private(set) var area = 0
    public var side: Int = 0 {
        didSet {
            area = side*side
        }
    }
    public init() {}
}

```



#### Syntax


- private class Project
- let car = Car("Ford", model: "Escape") //default internal
- public enum Genre
- private func calculateMarketCap()
- override internal func setupView()
- private(set) var area = 0



#### Remarks


1. ****Basic Remark:****

Below are the three access levels from highest access (least-restrictive) to lowest access (most-restrictive)

**Public** access allows access to classes, structs, variables, etc from any file within the model, but more importantly outside the module if the external file imports the module containing the public access code. It is popular to use public access when you create a framework.

**Internal** access allows files only with the module of the entities to use the entities. All entities have **internal** acccess level by default (with a few exceptions).

**Private** access prevents the entity from being used outside of that file.

1. ****Subclassing Remark:****

A subclass cannot have a higher access than its superclass.

1. ****Getter & Setter Remark:****

If propertyâ€™s setter is private the getter is internal (which is the default). Also you can assign access level for both the getter and the setter. These principles also apply to **subscripts** as well

1. ****General Remark:****

Other entity types include: Initializers, Protocols, Extensions, Generics, and Type Aliases
