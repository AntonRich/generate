# Visibility Modifiers


In Kotlin, there are 4 types of visibility modifiers are available.

**Public:** This can be accessed from anywhere.

**Private:** This can only be accessed from the module code.

**Protected:** This can only be accessed from the class defining it and any derived classes.

**Internal:** This can only be accessed from the scope of the class defining it.

**Public:** `public val name = "Avijit"`

**Private:** `private val name = "Avijit"`

**Protected:** `protected val name = "Avijit"`

**Internal:** `internal val name = "Avijit"`



#### Syntax


- `<visibility modifier> val/var <variable name> = <value>`
