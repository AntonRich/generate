# File/Folder Compression



## Creating zip archive from directory


```vb
System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory("myfolder", "archive.zip")

```

Create archive.zip file containing files which are in `myfolder`. In example paths are relative to program working directory. You can specify absolute paths.



## Extracting zip archive to directory


```vb
System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory("archive.zip", "myfolder")

```

Extracts archive.zip to myfolder directory. In example paths are relative to program working directory. You can specify absolute paths.



## Create zip archive dynamicaly


```vb
' Create filestream to file
Using fileStream = New IO.FileStream("archive.zip", IO.FileMode.Create)
    ' open zip archive from stream
    Using archive = New System.IO.Compression.ZipArchive(fileStream, IO.Compression.ZipArchiveMode.Create)
        ' create file_in_archive.txt in archive
        Dim zipfile = archive.CreateEntry("file_in_archive.txt")

        ' write Hello world to file_in_archive.txt in archive
        Using sw As New IO.StreamWriter(zipfile.Open())
            sw.WriteLine("Hello world")
        End Using

    End Using
End Using

```



## Adding File Compression to your project


1. In **Solution Explorer** go to your project, right click on **References** then **Add referenceâ€¦**
1. Search for Compression and select **System.IO.Compression.FileSystem** then press OK.
1. Add `Imports System.IO.Compression` to the top of your code file (before any class or module, with the other `Imports` statements).

```vb
Option Explicit On
Option Strict On

Imports System.IO.Compression

Public Class Foo

    ...

End Class

```

Plese note that this class (ZipArchive) is only available from .NET verison 4.5 onwards
