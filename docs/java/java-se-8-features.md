# Java SE 8 Features




## New Java SE 8 programming language features


<li>[Lambda Expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html), a new language feature, has been introduced in this release. They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.
<ul>
- [Method references](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html) provide easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.
- [Default methods](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html) enable new functionality to be added to the interfaces of libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.
- [New and Enhanced APIs That Take Advantage of Lambda Expressions and Streams](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/lambda_api_jdk8.html) in Java SE 8 describe new and enhanced classes that take advantage of lambda expressions and streams.

- [Target Typing](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html#target-typing) in [Lambda Expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html)
- [Type Inference](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html)
