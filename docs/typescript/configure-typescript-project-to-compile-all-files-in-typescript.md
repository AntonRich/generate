# Configure typescript project to compile all files in typescript.


creating your first .tsconfig configuration file which will tell the TypeScript compiler how to treat your .ts files



## Typescript Configuration file setup


- Enter command "**tsc --init**" and hit enter.
- Before that we need to compile ts file with command "**tsc app.ts**" now it is all defined in below config file automatically.

- If you will create another typescript and hit "tsc" command in command prompt or terminal javascript file will be automatically created for typescript file.
