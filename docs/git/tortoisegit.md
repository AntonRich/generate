# TortoiseGit



## Ignoring Files and Folders


Those that are using TortioseGit UI click <kbd>Right Mouse</kbd> on the file (or folder) you want to ignore -> `TortoiseGit` -> `Delete and add to ignore list`, here you can choose to ignore all files of that type or this specific file -> dialog will pop out Click `Ok` and you should be done.

New window will open -> `Give branch a name` -> Tick the box `Switch to new branch` (Chances are you want to start working with it after branching). -> Click `OK` and you should be done.

## Assume unchanged


If a file is changed, but you don't like to commit it, set the file as "Assume unchanged"
