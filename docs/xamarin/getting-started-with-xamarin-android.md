#### Remarks


Xamarin.Android allows you to create native Android applications using the same UI controls as you would in Java, except with the flexibility and elegance of a modern language (C#), the power of the .NET Base Class Library (BCL), and two first-class IDEs - Xamarin Studio and Visual Studio - at their fingertips.

For more information on installing Xamarin.Android on your Mac or Windows machine, refer to the [Getting Started](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/getting_started/installation/) guides on the Xamarin developer center
