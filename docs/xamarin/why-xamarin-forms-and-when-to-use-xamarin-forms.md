# Why Xamarin Forms and When to use Xamarin Forms



## Why Xamarin Forms and When to use Xamarin Forms


Xamarin is becoming more and more popular - it is hard to decide when to use Xamarin.Forms and when Xamarin.Platform (so Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android).

**First of all you should know for what kind of applications you can use Xamarin.Forms:**

<li>
Prototypes - to visualize how your application will look on the different devices.
</li>
<li>
Applications which not require platform specific functionality (like APIs) - but here please note that Xamarin is working busily to provide as many cross-platform compatibility as possible.
</li>
<li>
Applications where code sharing is crucial - more important than UI.
</li>
<li>
Applications where data displayed is more important than advanced functionality
</li>

**There are also many other factors:**

<li>
Who will be responsible for application development - if your team consists of experienced mobile developers they will be able to handle Xamarin.Forms easily. But if you have one developer per platform (native development) Forms can be bigger challenge.
</li>
<li>
Please also note that with Xamarin.Forms you can still encounter some issues sometimes - Xamarin.Forms platform is still being improved.
</li>
<li>
Fast development is sometimes very important - to reduce costs and time you can decide to use Forms.
</li>
<li>
When developing enterprise applications without any advanced functionality it is better to use Xamarin.Forms - it enables you to share mode code not event in mobile area but in general. Some portions of code can be shared across many platforms.
</li>

**You should not use Xamarin.Forms when:**

<li>
You have to create custom functionality and and access platform specific APIs
</li>
<li>
You have to create custom UI for the mobile application
</li>
<li>
When some functionality is not ready for Xamarin.Forms (like some specific behaviour on the mobile device)
</li>
<li>
Your team consists of platform specific mobile developers (mobile development in Java and/or Swift/Objective C)
</li>
