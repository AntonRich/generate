# Simulator


iOS, watchOS and tvOS Simulators are great ways to test your apps without using an actual device. Here we will talk about working with Simulators.



## Launching Simulator


You should go to Xcode -> Open Developer Tool:

> 
Using "Simulator", you could run iOS and tvOS, but "Simulator (Watch)" will only run watchOS.




## 3D / Force Touch simulation


Go to Hardware -> Touch Pressure:

To simulate a normal press, use Shift-Command-1 and a deep one, Shift-Command-2.

> 
If your MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, you could use your trackpad force to simulate 3D / Force Touch.




## Change Device Model


Go to Hardware -> Device:

## Navigating Simulator


### Home button

You should use Shift-Command-H to have an animation when closing an app.

### Lock

To lock the device, use Command-L.

### Rotation

Use Command with arrow keys.



#### Remarks


### Different Types of Simulators

- iOS Simulator
- watchOS Simulator
- tvOS Simulator
- Touch Bar Simulator

> 
There is no simulator for macOS, because Xcode is run on macOS and whenever needed, it will run the apps native.
