# ActiveModel



## Using ActiveModel::Validations


You can validate any object, even plain ruby.



#### Remarks


ActiveModel was created to extract the model behavior of ActiveRecord into a separate concern. This allows us to use ActiveModel behavior in any object, not just ActiveRecord models.

ActiveRecord objects include all of this behavior by default.
