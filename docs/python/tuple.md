# Tuple



#### Syntax


<li>
(1, a, "hello") # a must be a variable
</li>
<li>
()  # an empty tuple
</li>
<li>
(1,) # a 1-element tuple. `(1)` is not a tuple.
</li>
<li>
1, 2, 3 # the 3-element tuple (1, 2, 3)
</li>



#### Remarks


Parentheses are only needed for empty tuples or when used in a function call.

A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable and are hashable, so they can be used in sets and maps
