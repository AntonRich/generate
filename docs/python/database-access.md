# Database Access



#### Remarks


Python can handle many different types of databases. For each of these types a different API exists. So encourage similarity between those different API's, PEP 249 has been introduced.

> 
This API has been defined to encourage similarity between the Python modules that are used to access databases. By doing this, we hope to achieve a consistency leading to more easily understood modules, code that is generally more portable across databases, and a broader reach of database connectivity from Python.
