# Creating a Console Application using a Plain-Text Editor and the C# Compiler (csc.exe)



## Creating a Console application using a Plain-Text Editor and the C# Compiler


In order to use a plain-text editor to create a Console application that is written in C#, you'll need the C# Compiler. The C# Compiler (csc.exe), can be found at the following location:
`%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe`

**N.B.** Depending upon which version of the .NET Framework that is installed on your system, you may need to change the path above, accordingly.

### Saving the Code

1. Open the Run dialog, by using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Windows Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>
1. Type `notepad`, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Paste the example code below, into Notepad
1. Save the file as `ConsoleApp.cs`, by going to **File** â†’ **Save As...**, then entering `ConsoleApp.cs` in the 'File Name' text field, then selecting `All Files` as the file-type.
1. Click `Save`

### Compiling the Source Code

```cs
%WINDIR%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe /t:exe /out:"C:\Users\yourUserName\Documents\ConsoleApp.exe" "C:\Users\yourUserName\Documents\ConsoleApp.cs"

```

Now, go back to where you originally saved your `ConsoleApp.cs` file. You should now see an executable file (`ConsoleApp.exe`). Double-click `ConsoleApp.exe` to open it.

That's it! Your console application has been compiled. An executable file has been created and you now have a working Console app.

```cs
using System;

namespace ConsoleApp
{
    class Program
    {
        private static string input = String.Empty;

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            goto DisplayGreeting;

            DisplayGreeting:
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello! What is your name?");

                input = Console.ReadLine();

                if (input.Length >= 1)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(
                        "Hello, " + 
                        input + 
                        ", enter 'Exit' at any time to exit this app.");

                    goto AwaitFurtherInstruction;
                }
                else
                {
                    goto DisplayGreeting;
                }
            }

            AwaitFurtherInstruction:
            {
                input = Console.ReadLine();

                if(input.ToLower() == "exit")
                {
                    input = String.Empty;

                    Environment.Exit(0);
                }
                else
                {
                    goto AwaitFurtherInstruction;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
