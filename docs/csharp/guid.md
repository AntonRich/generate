# Guid


GUID (or UUID) is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier' (or 'Universally Unique Identifier'). It is a 128-bit integer number used to identify resources.



## Getting the string representation of a Guid


A string representation of a Guid can be obtained by using the built in `ToString` method

```cs
string myGuidString = myGuid.ToString();

```

Depending on your needs you can also format the Guid, by adding a format type argument to the `ToString` call.

```cs
var guid = new Guid("7febf16f-651b-43b0-a5e3-0da8da49e90d");

// None          "7febf16f651b43b0a5e30da8da49e90d"
Console.WriteLine(guid.ToString("N"));

// Hyphens       "7febf16f-651b-43b0-a5e3-0da8da49e90d"
Console.WriteLine(guid.ToString("D"));

// Braces        "{7febf16f-651b-43b0-a5e3-0da8da49e90d}"
Console.WriteLine(guid.ToString("B"));

// Parentheses   "(7febf16f-651b-43b0-a5e3-0da8da49e90d)"
Console.WriteLine(guid.ToString("P"));

// Hex           "{0x7febf16f,0x651b,0x43b0{0xa5,0xe3,0x0d,0xa8,0xda,0x49,0xe9,0x0d}}"
Console.WriteLine(guid.ToString("X"));

```



## Creating a Guid


These are the most common ways to create an instance of Guid:

- Creating an empty guid (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`):

```cs
Guid g = Guid.Empty;
Guid g2 = new Guid();

```


- Creating a new (pseudorandom) Guid:

```cs
Guid g = Guid.NewGuid();

```


- Creating Guids with a specific value:

```cs
Guid g = new Guid("0b214de7-8958-4956-8eed-28f9ba2c47c6");
Guid g2 = new Guid("0b214de7895849568eed28f9ba2c47c6");
Guid g3 = Guid.Parse("0b214de7-8958-4956-8eed-28f9ba2c47c6");

```



## Declaring a nullable GUID


Like other value types, GUID also has a nullable type which can take null value.

Declaration :

```cs
Guid? myGuidVar = null;

```

This is particularly useful when retrieving data from the data base when there is a possibility that value from a table is NULL.



#### Remarks


`Guid`s are **Globally Unique Identifiers**, also known as **UUID**'s, **Universally Unique Identifiers**.

They are 128-bit pseudorandom values. There are so many valid `Guid`s (about 10^18 `Guid`s for each cell of every people on Earth) that if they are generated by a good pseudorandom algorithm, they can be considered unique in the whole universe by all practical means.

`Guid`s are most often used as primary keys in databases. Their advantage is that you don't have to call the database to get a new ID that is (almost) guaranteed to be unique.
