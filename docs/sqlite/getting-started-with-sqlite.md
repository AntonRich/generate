# Getting started with sqlite



## Installation


SQLite is a [C](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/c/topics) library that is typically [compiled](http://www.sqlite.org/howtocompile.html) directly into the application by [downloading](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) the source code of the latest version, and adding the `sqlite3.c` file to the project.

Many script languages (e.g., [Perl](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/perl/topics), [Python](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/python/topics), [Ruby](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/ruby/topics), etc.) and frameworks (e.g., [Android](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/android/topics)) have support for SQLite; this is done with a built-in copy of the SQLite library, which does not need to be installed separately.

For testing SQL, it might be useful to use the command-line shell (`sqlite3` or `sqlite3.exe`).
It is already shipped with most Linux distributions; on Windows, [download](http://www.sqlite.org/download.html) the precompiled binaries in the `sqlite-tools` package, and extract them somewhere.



## Documentation


SQLite already has extensive [documentation](http://www.sqlite.org/docs.html), which should not be duplicated here.
